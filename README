This is a simple perl implementation of the UDDI inquire interface.
You can find out more about UDDI at http://www.uddi.org.

The UDDI module provide functions that let you send requests to the
UDDI database servers.

This release is to be regarded as an alpha.  Documentation is lacking.
Interface still subject to change.

Usage is something like this:

   use UDDI;

   my $list = UDDI::find_business(name => "a");
   my $bis = $list->businessInfos;
   for my $b ($bis->businessInfo) {
       print $b->name, "\n";
   }
